# Skulkapp

Simple mobile scorekeeper for the Skul King card game. Track players, log rounds, and keep totals in one place.

## Features
- Add players and set starting scores
- Capture round results with bids, wins, and bonuses
- Auto-calculated totals and standings after each round
- Quick edits/undo when you mistype
- Light, fast UI tuned for play-at-the-table

## Usage
- Create a new game, add players, and start round 1.  
- Enter each player’s bid, tricks won, and any bonuses/penalties.  
- Advance rounds; the app totals scores and shows the leader.  
- Use edit/undo if you need to fix an entry.

## Roadmap
1) Core UI: game setup flow, player list, round entry form, live scoreboard
2) Scoring engine: bids/wins math, bonuses/penalties, validation, undo/edit flows
3) Data layer: local storage first; optional sync/API later
4) UX polish: shortcuts for common scores, better error states, accessibility pass
5) Nice-to-haves: offline-first sync, export/share, themes/custom rules
